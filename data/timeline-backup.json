In the 1940s, a group of Stanford’s electrical engineers––including Robert A. Helliwell, Laurence A. Manning, and O. G. Villard, Jr.—had tested the idea that radio signals bounced off meteor trails. As faculty, they formed the core of Stanford’s Radio Science Laboratory, later joined by professors Ronald Bracewell, Allen M. Peterson, and others. More than a decade later, the Dish enabled vastly expanded studies of scattering effects in Earth’s ionosphere and was used to detect Soviet radar by capturing radio signals that bounced off the moon.

The division aimed to prepare engineers who developed the ability to integrate technical and artistic skills with social and environmental understanding to create innovative solutions for complex challenges.
