In the 1940s, a group of Stanford’s electrical engineers––including Robert A. Helliwell, Laurence A. Manning, and O. G. Villard, Jr.—had tested the idea that radio signals bounced off meteor trails. As faculty, they formed the core of Stanford’s Radio Science Laboratory, later joined by professors Ronald Bracewell, Allen M. Peterson, and others. More than a decade later, the Dish enabled vastly expanded studies of scattering effects in the earth’s ionosphere and was used to detect Soviet radar by capturing radio signals that bounced off the moon. The Dish is still used today for satellite calibrations, spacecraft command and telemetry, and radio astronomy measurements.  Stanford News Service.",
