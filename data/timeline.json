Despite Terman’s absence, in December 1944 Stanford President Donald Tresidder named Terman the third dean of the School of Engineering, with a strong endorsement from the engineering faculty. “Dr. Terman’s scholarly contributions in the field of electrical engineering and his administration of one of America’s largest war research projects place him among the outstanding engineers in the country,” Tresidder said, announcing Terman’s appointment.

In the 1940s, a group of Stanford’s electrical engineers––including Robert A. Helliwell, Laurence A. Manning, and O. G. Villard, Jr.—had tested the idea that radio signals bounced off meteor trails. As faculty, they formed the core of Stanford’s Radio Science Laboratory, later joined by professors Ronald Bracewell, Allen M. Peterson, and others. More than a decade later, the Dish enabled vastly expanded studies of scattering effects in Earth’s ionosphere and was used to detect Soviet radar by capturing radio signals that bounced off the moon.

The division aimed to prepare engineers who developed the ability to integrate technical and artistic skills with social and environmental understanding to create innovative solutions for complex challenges.
