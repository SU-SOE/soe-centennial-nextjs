Ryan High-Voltage Laboratory debuted on September 17, 1926, with a public demonstration of its 2,100,000-volt test station containing six 350,000-volt transformer units, capable of producing the highest voltage ever obtained at commercial frequency. Erected at a cost of nearly $500,000, it was the largest university electrical lab in existence at the time. | Berton W. Crandall photographs, Box 24, Hoover Institution Library & Archives."
